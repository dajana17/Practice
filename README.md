# PRACTICE
Data processing for genomics


## Objective
Variant Calling Pipeline


## Description
    - Prepare data: implementing FASTP tool which provide all-in-one preprocessing for FASTQ files
    - Execute check for presence of INDEX and BAM file
    - Alignment: map reads on a reference genome using Bowtie2
    - Visualise statistics from the pipeline: Summarising outputs of FASTP tool and Bowtie2 alignment using MultiQC tool
